Employing advanced multivariate data analysis techniques to unravel the complex interplay of factors influencing wine quality

This study delves into the scientific aspect, employing advanced multivariate data analysis techniques to unravel the complex interplay of factors influencing wine quality. First is to analyze the wine data set given to provide a structured approach to find the discernible patterns and correlation between different variables with the help of R. To assess the type and quality of wine, four distinct predictive models were employed and evaluated in Python using scikit-learn library: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. The evaluation of these models was based on two key performance metrics: testing accuracy and AUC (Area Under the Curve) scores. Additionally, the analysis was supplemented with confusion matrices to provide insights into the models' classification performance. Moreover, an interpretive analysis is conducted to investigate how wine data's linearity, distribution, and normality can influence the selection of models.
